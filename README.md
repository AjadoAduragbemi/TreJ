# TreJ

TRE JNI Wrapper(TREJ) provides a Java interface that allows you access the native functions that have been defined in [TRE](https://github.com/laurikari/tre/).

[TRE](https://github.com/laurikari/tre/) is a lightweight, robust, and efficient POSIX compliant regex matching package with support for approximate (fuzzy) matching. For more information on TRE, see [https://github.com/laurikari/tre/](https://github.com/laurikari/tre/)

**WARNING!** TRE currently has no support for `look-ahead` or `look-behind` assertions, and by the look of things it might never have. ***Nix** support is not yet available.
